# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Challenge 
The challenge is to add the tectonic plate plot into the Earthquakes map, add a third map style, and to turn the tectonic plate line as an overlay layer to be toggled on and off.  

## Output 
Here are the sample screenshots: 
1) Default view: Street map style displaying both earthquakes and tectonic plate.

<img alt = "street map with earthquakes and tectonic plate" src = "https://github.com/pegkhiev/Mapping_Earthquakes/blob/master/Earthquakes_Challenge/image/street.png">

2) Satellite view with just earthquakes (tectonic plate toggled off).

3) Light view with just tectonic plate (earthquakes toggeled off).
